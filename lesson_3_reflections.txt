When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there are some changes that you don't want on your local repository match the online repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are copies of other repositories made within GitHub.
clones are copies of repositories to the local machine.
Branches are different versions of history of changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It will help to easily compare the copy and the local branch.
