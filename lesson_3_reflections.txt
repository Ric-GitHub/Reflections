When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to share your changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there are some changes that you don't want on your local repository match the online repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
forks are copies of other repositories made within GitHub.
clones are copies of repositories to the local machine.
Branches are different versions of history of changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It will help to easily compare the copy and the local branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Creating different copies of my file at different logical changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Make changes in a separate branch when you need a different version of the branch.
One will let you work on the side without changing the master. The other will allow you to make changes that you may be able to share with other.
